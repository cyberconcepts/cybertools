  >>> config = '''
  ... controller(names=['core.sample'])
  ... scheduler(name='core')
  ... logger(name='default', standard=30)
  ... system.winapi = 'use_outlook'

  >>> from cybertools.agent.main import setup
  >>> master = setup(config)
  Starting agent application...
  Using controllers core.sample.


OutlookCrawler
==============

The agent uses Twisted's cooperative multitasking model.

OutlookCrawler is derived from MailCrawler. The OutlookCrawler returns a deferred
which itself holds a list of MailResource Objects.

Returns a deferred that must be supplied with a callback method (and in
most cases also an errback method).

The TestCase here is using subsidiary methods which replace calls to the "real Outlook
dlls".

  >>> controller = master.controllers[0]
  >>> controller.createAgent('crawl.outlook', 'sample02')

In the next step we request the start of a job, again via the controller.

  >>> controller.enterJob('sample', 'sample02', params=dict(inbox=True))

The job is not executed immediately - we have to hand over control to
the twisted reactor first.

  >>> from cybertools.agent.tests import tester
  >>> tester.iterate()
  Job 00001 completed; result: [<cybertools.agent.crawl.mail.MailResource object at ...>];
