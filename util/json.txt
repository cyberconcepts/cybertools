  >>> from cybertools.util.json import dumps, loads

Encoding basic Python object hierarchies::

    >>> dumps(['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, 1.0, 2)}])
    '["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]'
    >>> print dumps("\"foo\bar")
    "\"foo\bar"
    >>> print dumps(u'\u1234')
    "\u1234"
    >>> print dumps('\\')
    "\\"
    >>> print dumps({"c": 0, "b": 0, "a": 0}, sort_keys=True)
    {"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}

Compact encoding::

    >>> dumps([1,2,3,{'4': 5, '6': 7}], separators=(',',':'))
    '[1,2,3,{"4":5,"6":7}]'

Pretty printing::

    >>> print dumps({'4': 5, '6': 7}, sort_keys=True, indent=4)
    {
        "4": 5,
        "6": 7
    }

Decoding JSON::

    >>> loads('["foo", {"bar":["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]')
    [u'foo', {u'bar': [u'baz', None, 1.0, 2]}]
    >>> loads('"\\"foo\\bar"')
    u'"foo\x08ar'
